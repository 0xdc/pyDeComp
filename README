pyDecomp is a flexible library of various compression and decompression
and contents methods run via subprocess calls.

pyDecomp comprises two main classes, CompressMap which can hold either
compress or decompress definitions and ContentsMap which handles generating
contents listings of the compressed archives.  The reason for it's existence
is to create a simple consistent yet configurable interface for applications.
This library makes it easy to extend with new definitions as new
compress/decompress methods become available.

NOTE: At this time, contents generation for squashfs types is not complete.
